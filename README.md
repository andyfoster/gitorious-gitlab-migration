# Gitorious to Gitlab.com Mass-Migration Script

Run this PHP script on the command line to migrate all your Gitorious repositories to GitLab.

We used this to move more than 100 repositories into GitLab with no loss of commit data.

The GitLab API is full-featured and well-documented but takes a while to get the hang of.
